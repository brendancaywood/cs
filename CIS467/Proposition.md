# UniFied

## Student Transactions, Simplified.

### What is UniFied?

UniFied is a simple peer-to-peer marketplace which allows for people in the academic environment to exchange goods and services safely and easily. Similar the craigslist, these classifieds start out as simple anonymous posts, however, once an interest is established, people can communicate either through the application or with one-another separately in order to garner further interest, or to finalize a deal. It will leverage an encouraged use of campus environments to handle transactions, and the use of gvsu.edu email addresses to sign up allows for quick apprehension of people who commit various crimes against another person. This application ensures a safe, and simple way to buy and sell things with other students, or even just arrange a group of people to go to social events with.

### What problem does it solve?

Commonly, there are some things that cannot be posted under the gaze of the public eye. If I want to buy a car from someone, I use craigslist, but there does not exist a service for things like haircuts, textbooks, tutoring, or even just spreading awareness about your club or organization on campus without exposing all of this information to the larger community. The only currently popular option is via the use of facebook groups. With a quick observation of even the official Grand Valley pages, it is found that the largest of the pages are still at only about 25% of Grand Valley's total population in terms of membership. This is worsened by the fact that many members of these now years-old pages have since graduated or transfered. The problem therein lies in the fact that pages are too far dispersed and difficult to discover, and the "official" ones do not leave much to be found in terms of activity. There is no simple, standardized system to organize these postings in a way that only authorized GVSU students and businesses can distribute information or requests for goods and services.

### Who does it serve?

It serves everyone in the organization. Anyone with a gvsu.edu email address (and other schools if they join) can view postings for their particular school. The best part is that it no longer segments the groups by class, or other types of superficial affiliation. This also allows for faculty members to locate students for research opportunities, put out class awareness, and other things that they may feel less comfortable putting their name on in a public forum.

### How does it work?

It's simple! People make postings and others interact with them. It goes deeper than that though. The options for monetization go beyond the simple scope of advertisements. The platform will utilize paid promotional content marketing. Students can pay a small fee (to be determined) per week to have their posts in the "featured" section of the website. This will allow for student organizations as well as Grand Valley itself to spread messaging to the entire student body without the use of email. This also empowers students to do the same since campus-wide emails are reserved for official matters only. Local businesses like apartments and restaurants will be able to parter and register with the school to pay a small membership fee to create an account. With this account they'll be able to make postings and pay for promoted content to advertise their business. This creates a minimally invasive, culturally inclusive way to show advertisements without needing to harm the user experience or rely on shady business practices and psychological manipulation. 

### Competition

Competition is virtually non existent. Craigslist and ULoop are the two main ones that have come up, but they lack the ability of exclusivity. They have no systems in place which allow for students to only have their content viewed by students in their same geographic area or school. Anyone can go to those websites and begin browsing without even having an account made on the service. The beauty of UniFied is in its exclusivity. This promotes safety and reliability of access knowing that interactions do not occur behind a "mask" so to speak. Grand Valley will be able to partner with us to moderate posts and handle issues of criminal nature.
